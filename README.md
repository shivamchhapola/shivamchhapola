Hi, I'm Shivam Chhapola, a web developer.

I mainly work with MERN stack and Next.js to build web apps but I also have some experience with Vue.js, PHP and ASP.NET.

- [Pokecards-Pokemon card generator](https://github.com/shivamchhapola/pokecards)

In addition to web development, I have experience in programming languages like Python, C/C++, Java, and Lua.
